# Edge- Versus Level-Driven Triggers

## Edge-driven triggers

A handler is triggered when state changes

## Level-driven triggers

A handler is triggered after the state is checked at regular intervals and if certain conditions are met.

Level-driven is not scalable

Kubernetes implement  edge-triggered, level-driven logic with additional resync.
